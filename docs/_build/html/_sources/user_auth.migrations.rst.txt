   This module includes various migration files, each representing a specific database schema change. These migrations are generated automatically by Django when you make changes to your models using the `makemigrations` management command.

   It is recommended not to manually edit the migration files unless you have a deep understanding of Django migrations and their implications on the database structure. Instead, use Django's migration commands to apply or revert migrations as needed.

   For more information on Django database migrations, refer to the official Django documentation.
